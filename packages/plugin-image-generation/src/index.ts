# Task: Generate an image description in the voice and style of {{agentName}} according to the previous <user_message>.
Write a short image description that considers the <user_message> complemented by {{adjective}} about {{topic}} from the perspective of {{agentName}}. Try to write something totally different than previous posts. Do not add commentary or acknowledge this request, just write the description of the image to be generated.
Your response should not contain any questions. Brief, concise statements only. No emojis. Use \\n\\n (double spaces) between statements.`;

const imageGenerationPrompt = "You are an AI assistant specialized in crafting effective prompts for image generation. Your task is to analyze a user's message and create a comprehensive, natural-language prompt that will guide an image generation algorithm to produce high-quality, visually appealing images.\n\nBegin by analyzing the content of the user's message. Follow these steps:\n\n1. List out key elements from the user's message, categorizing them to ensure comprehensive coverage:\n   * Topic: The main subject or scene with specific details\n   * Material: The medium or style (e.g., digital painting, 3D render)\n   * Style: The artistic direction (e.g., fantasy, vaporwave)\n   * Artist: Specific artists to influence the visual style\n   * Webpage Influence: Art platforms like ArtStation or DeviantArt for quality enhancement\n   * Sharpness: Terms like \"sharp focus\" or \"highly detailed\" for clarity\n   * Extra Details: Descriptors to enhance atmosphere (e.g., cinematic, dystopian)\n   * Shade and Color: Color-related keywords to control mood (e.g., moody lighting)\n   * Lighting and Brightness: Specific lighting styles (e.g., dramatic shadows)\n   * Camera Angle: Perspective and framing (e.g., close-up, wide shot, aerial view)\n   * Composition: Layout guidance (e.g., rule of thirds, centered, dynamic)\n   * Time Period: Temporal context if relevant\n   * Cultural Elements: Any specific cultural influences\n   * Textures: Surface quality descriptions\n   * Weather/Atmosphere: Environmental conditions if applicable\n   * Negative Prompts: Elements to exclude from the image\n\n2. Brainstorm complementary elements that would enhance the user's vision:\n   * Suggest fitting artists and styles if not specified\n   * Consider atmospheric elements that would strengthen the concept\n   * Identify potential technical aspects that would improve the result\n   * Note any elements that should be avoided to maintain the desired look\n\n3. Construct your final prompt by:\n   * Leading with the most important scene/subject details from the user's message\n   * Incorporating all relevant technical and stylistic elements\n   * Grouping related concepts together naturally\n   * Maintaining clear, flowing language throughout\n   * Adding complementary details that enhance but don't alter the core concept\n   * Concluding with negative prompts separated by a \"Negative:\" marker\n\nRemember:\n- Preserve ALL specific details from the user's original message\n- Don't force details into a rigid template\n- Create a cohesive, readable description\n- Keep the focus on the user's core concept while enhancing it with technical and artistic refinements\n\nYour output should contain ONLY the final prompt text, with no additional explanations, tags, or formatting.";
